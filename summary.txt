Objects:
- User: owner of points and rewards (through RewardManager)
- RewardManager: User's wallet that manage points and rewards
- Transaction: paid proof of purchase. Its amount determines how many Point quantity a user will get
- Point: a single Point object issued per transaction (it)
- Reward: X amount of Points / etc can be converted to a Reward


Flow:
- To issue a point to user, client can call RewardManager#issue_point(transaction)
- To issue a reward to user, client can call RewardManager#issue_reward


Assumption:
- Point is unique per each transaciton. Cannot combine 2 or more transactions to create a Point object
- Reward conversion rule can be based by Point or other aspects. It's not strictly related to Points
- Transactions less than $100 woould not generate a Point object
- Thus we also need a Transaction object. Some Reward conversion rule are based on Transaction
